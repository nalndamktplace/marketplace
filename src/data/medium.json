Readers are the owners of physical books and thus are free to resell them. However, with eBooks, readers don't have ownership of them. In fact, the ownership of eBooks is with the Reader platform which charges hefty fees by selling them to the readers and offering pseudo- ownership to the readers. With this pseudo-ownership, readers can only read their eBooks but can't sell them to anyone. And this is where nBook comes into the picture.</p>\n<p>nBooks are NFT based ebooks that impart an important property to the eBooks that had been missing so far: ownership. The NFT allows the transfer of ownership from one reader to another. Using NFT different types of eBooks can be minted based on features.</p>\n<p><strong>Type-</strong> There could be multiple types of copies of any title based on its cover design, the color of pages, graphics, and information on trivia.</p>\n<p><strong>No. of copies -</strong>Authors/publishers can set a number on how many copies a title will have. A basis feature will allow nBook to have an unlimited number of copies. A new copy will be minted every time someone buys the title. If required a title can have two variants with one having limited no. of copies (just like limited edition) and the other will unlimited no. as mass edition</p>\n<p><strong>Decay factor</strong> — Decay factor will be assigned to every copy of a used nBook. Authors will have the right to decide which type of nBook will have what decay factor</p>\n<p>nBooks is the core of Nalnda's business model. To convert eBooks into nBook we use NFT 2.0 technology. The NFT 2.0 technology will use one NFT exclusively to access another NFT using public-private key encryption.</p>\n<p>An overview of how Nalnda will do it:</p>\n<p>the eBook will have two parts:</p>\n<p><strong>a. Content </strong>— The part that readers will reader</p>\n<p><strong>b. Book Cover </strong>— The part that readers will buy to access the content. Readers will be able to resell the cover just like any other NFTs. The new owner of the NFT will have access to the content while the previous owner will lose ownership of the content after selling it. Content and Book Cover will have a one-to-many relation</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*c7qyysStDPvs2gux\"><figcaption>Content and Cover will have a one-to-many relationship</figcaption></figure><p>Content stored on decentralized storage can be accessed publicly using the CID ( Content Identifier).

Readers are the owners of physical books and thus are free to resell them. However, with eBooks, readers don't have ownership of them. In fact, the ownership of eBooks is with the Reader platform which charges hefty fees by selling them to the readers and offering pseudo- ownership to the readers. With this pseudo-ownership, readers can only read their eBooks but can't sell them to anyone. And this is where nBook comes into the picture.</p>\n<p>nBooks are NFT based ebooks that impart an important property to the eBooks that had been missing so far: ownership. The NFT allows the transfer of ownership from one reader to another. Using NFT different types of eBooks can be minted based on features.</p>\n<p><strong>Type-</strong> There could be multiple types of copies of any title based on its cover design, the color of pages, graphics, and information on trivia.</p>\n<p><strong>No. of copies -</strong>Authors/publishers can set a number on how many copies a title will have. A basis feature will allow nBook to have an unlimited number of copies. A new copy will be minted every time someone buys the title. If required a title can have two variants with one having limited no. of copies (just like limited edition) and the other will unlimited no. as mass edition</p>\n<p><strong>Decay factor</strong> — Decay factor will be assigned to every copy of a used nBook. Authors will have the right to decide which type of nBook will have what decay factor</p>\n<p>nBooks is the core of Nalnda's business model. To convert eBooks into nBook we use NFT 2.0 technology. The NFT 2.0 technology will use one NFT exclusively to access another NFT using public-private key encryption.</p>\n<p>An overview of how Nalnda will do it:</p>\n<p>the eBook will have two parts:</p>\n<p><strong>a. Content </strong>— The part that readers will reader</p>\n<p><strong>b. Book Cover </strong>— The part that readers will buy to access the content. Readers will be able to resell the cover just like any other NFTs. The new owner of the NFT will have access to the content while the previous owner will lose ownership of the content after selling it. Content and Book Cover will have a one-to-many relation</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*c7qyysStDPvs2gux\"><figcaption>Content and Cover will have a one-to-many relationship</figcaption></figure><p>Content stored on decentralized storage can be accessed publicly using the CID ( Content Identifier).

For every stakeholder to work towards the benefit of the eco-system there will be various incentive structures that will incentivize everyone stakeholder based on their input. Nalnda marketplace Token (ticker $NALNDA) will be the native token of the Nalnda Protocol and will be used to incentivize all the stakeholders in the Nalnda ecosystem. Although the stakeholders will have the freedom to use fiat-backed stable coins for basic service (buys and sell nBooks), for all other use cases NALNDA token will be used.</p>\n<p>NMT has the below-mentioned functionality in Nalnda Protocol:</p>\n<ul><li>Access — NALNDA is a utility token that provides access to the features offered within the ecosystem</li></ul>\n<p>• Staking — Staking NALNDA will provide special privileges to the holders</p>\n<p>• Governance — NALNDA token holders will have the right to vote on proposals to change the system parameters.</p>\n<p>Stakeholders will use NALNDA for the below-mentioned use cases:</p>\n<p>• Publishers/ Authors — Publishers/ Authors will have to pay fees for listing and creating nBooks. This fee can only be paid using the NALNDA token. Publishers will also be able to incentivize readers with NALNDA tokens for reading specific books. This will help publishers to generate revenue from less popular works and market them.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Readers — Reading a book on Nalnda will incentivize readers based on the. of pages read and time spent on the platform. With time the incentive factor for a reader will increase or decrease based on the reader’s involvement on the platform. However, this incentive factor will have a minimum and maximum factor.</li>\n<li>• Service Providers — Service providers can charge fees for providing services. This fee will be charged in NALNDA token</li>\n<li>• Social Platform — The inbuilt social platform will allow readers, fan clubs, service providers, and authors to socialize and connect. NALNDA will be used as a tipping mechanism on this social platform.</li>\n<li>• Traders — will have to stake tokens for participating in the launch of new titles</li>\n</ul>\n<p>NALNDA will be an ERC-20 token launched on Polygon Chain with a max supply of 500 million tokens.
